# Learning Quantum Computing

## Overview
This repository documents my journey into **Quantum Computing** — a field that combines physics, mathematics, and computer science to solve problems in fundamentally new ways.

The goal of this repo is to track my progress as I move from basic quantum concepts to building and simulating quantum algorithms.

## What This Repository Is

This is a **learning lab** where I:

- Study how quantum computers work
- Write quantum programs and simulations
- Implement and test quantum algorithms
- Explore how quantum information differs from classical computing

---

## Topics Covered

- Qubits and quantum states  
- Superposition and entanglement  
- Quantum gates (X, Y, Z, H, CNOT, etc.)  
- Quantum circuits  
- Measurement and probability  
- Bloch sphere representation  
- Quantum teleportation and Bell states  
- Quantum algorithms:
  - Deutsch–Jozsa
  - Grover’s search
  - Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)
  - Shor’s algorithm (conceptual)

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Qiskit** (IBM Quantum SDK)
- **NumPy & SciPy** (for matrix math)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (experiments and visualization)
- Quantum simulators (local + IBM Quantum cloud)

---

## What I’m Learning

- How quantum states are represented as vectors  
- How gates act as matrices on qubits  
- How entanglement enables non-classical behavior  
- How quantum speedups are achieved  
- How noise and decoherence affect real hardware

## Why This Repo Exists

Quantum computing is one of the most advanced areas of modern computing.  
This repository exists to:

- Build a **strong mathematical and physical foundation**
- Gain **hands-on experience** with real quantum frameworks
- Understand how **future computers will solve problems differently**

## Notes

- This is not a finished product — it is a **learning journey**
- Code may evolve or be rewritten as my understanding improves
- Mistakes are part of the process
